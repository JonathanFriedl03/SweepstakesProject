I used dependency injection in my marketing firm class constructor. this was done to not have to pass in a specific type of manager "stack or queue", now
both types are qualified. The purpose here is to allow the constructor to not have to be dependent upon one type of manager, again stack or queue.
Factory pattern was used in the SweepstakesFactory since stack and queue were both were created by it regardless of type rather its determined when the user chose which type they prefered to use.
